# MEMORY.md - OpenClaw Azure

## Project Genesis
- **Created:** 2026-02-06
- **Goal:** Open source Azure deployment template for OpenClaw
- **Target:** Non-technical users who want self-hosted AI assistants

## Key Decisions
- Renamed from "Clawdbot" to "OpenClaw" for the open source project
- Dedicated agent + Discord channel for focused development
- ARM templates for one-click deployment
